            <h1>How to Make a Cappuccino.</h1>
            <p>
                The Cappuccino is believed to have been first invented in Italy in the early 1900s, with the first recorded referencing being cited as appearing in the 1930s. However, its etymology goes even further back and comes from the word ‘cappuccio’. One of the first uses of this term is in the first part of Dante’s Divine Comedy, Inferno, and was used by the poet to describe a group of reformist friars who opted to cover themselves from head-to-toe in brown fabric. It is from this that the word cappuccino originates as the espresso is served ‘cloaked’ in milk. Though an Italian word, there is enough evidence around to suggest that the Germans adopted and then adapted it. In 1790, there is a recorded example of a 'Capuzinerkaffee', a type of coffee where the espresso is mixed with cream, sugar and spice before being poured over an egg. However, by the 20th Century, the contracted Kapuziner simply meant a coffee with a little bit of milk. What we would refer to as a cappuccino today truly took off in popularity after World War II and the simple drink of espresso and foamed milk has gone on to become a permanent fixture on the menu boards of coffee shops all over the world.

            <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Espresso</li>
                <li>Steamed Milk​</li> 
                <li>Foamed Milk</li>
            </ul><br>
            <h1>Methods:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Foam and texture the required quantity of milk - Remember! We want more foam than steamed milk.</li>
                <li>Brew a single or double espresso (as per taste or order) directly into your serving cup.</li>
                <li>Gently swirl the milk to release any large air bubbles - tap the milk jug against a counter to remove any stubborn bubbles.</li>
                <li>Pour the milk over the espresso from a low height for a smooth drink.</li>
                <li>Finish by giving the milk a slight 'wiggle' to ensure foam transfers from milk jug to the cup to top off your Cappuccino.</li>
