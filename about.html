            <h1>What is Espresso?</h1>
            <p>
                Espresso (ess-PRESS-oh) is a full-flavored, concentrated form of coffee 
                that is served in “shots.” It is made by forcing pressurized, hot water 
                through very finely ground coffee beans. This process is called “pulling a shot.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Unlike most coffees, espressos have “crema.” This is a froth of reddish-brown color 
                that forms when air bubbles combine with the soluble oils of a fine-ground coffee. 
                The crema adds to the rich flavor and alluring aroma of espresso. Oftentimes, the crema 
                is a mark of a proper espresso made with a quality, perfectly ground coffee by a skilled barista.
                Crema and espresso’s quick extraction process give espresso a fuller flavor, longer aftertaste 
                and lower caffeine content than drip coffee.

            <h1>How to Drink Espresso</h1>
            <p>
                By itself, espresso is served in 'shots' with each shot measuring about 1 ounce. Double espressos 
                are two shots (also called 'Doppios') and are more popular than single espressos.
                Regardless of the size, espressos are usually poured into a demitasse cups. These are the small, often 
                white, cups you see in coffee shops and restaurants and each holds 2 to 4 ounces of espresso.
                For quality control purposes, many coffee houses choose to only offer double shots. Other coffeehouses 
                also offer single shots and lungos.
                Though a serving of espresso is called a 'shot,' it is not meant to be drunk in a single gulp like you might 
                take a shot of tequila. Instead, espresso is meant to be sipped slowly so you can enjoy it's full, rich flavor.
