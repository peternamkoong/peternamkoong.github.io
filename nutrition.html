            <h1>Health Benefits of Drinking Espresso</h1>
            <p>
                Espressos are most known for being little cups of delicious energy. They help 
                pick us up when we're feeling down and need an extra boost to get through the day.
                Most people don't think of drinking espresso as a way to maintain their health.
                However, espresso has a long list of different health benefits that should no longer 
                go unnoticed. We're here to help you learn all about them.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Strengthens Long-Term Memory</h2>
            <p>
                It has been shown that drinking espresso can help with  your memory. Not only does it aid 
                in your brain's retention of stored information, it also can be helpful in recalling that information.
                If you were to have an espresso while studying for a school exam and then had an espresso right 
                before the exam, the espresso helps you to remember the material better.
                It's similar to the idea that chewing gum during study can help you remember the information 
                if you were to chew gum during the test.
                Except espresso has many more benefits that will help you at the same time.
