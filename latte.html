            <h1>How to Make a Latte.</h1>
            <p>
                Coffee and milk go together like bread and butter, and the notion of mixing the two has been around for years. Whether known as a café au lait, a caffe con leche or a milchkaffee, our continental friends were creating milky coffees for decades – if not centuries – before W.D Howells first mentioned the term ‘latte’ in an essay penned in 1867. Despite existing in various forms across continental Europe it is the Americans who are widely credited for popularising and commercialising the drink. Synonymous with the Seattle coffee scene of the 1980s, the latte soon became the standard speciality drink of choice of many and has remained a popular option ever since.

            <h1>Methods:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Prepare an espresso (single or double) directly into a latte glass.</li>
                <li>1/3 fill your milk jug — whole milk is recommended.</li>
                <li>Purge your steam arm prior to attempting to steam your milk.</li>
                <li>Foam your milk prior to brewing your espresso, paying attention to creating a nice smooth microfoam.</li>
                <li>After foaming/frothing your milk, gently tap the jug or bump on a table to remove any unwanted large air bubbles.</li>
                <li>Begin pouring the frothed milk to your espresso from a relatively high position.</li>
                <li>Continue to pour whilst lowering the milk and steepening your pouring angle.</li>
                <li>Ensure a small amount of stiff milk foam sits on top after pouring.</li>
                <li>Enjoy your Latte!</li>
